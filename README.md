# README for macaque-receptor-gradients


This GitHub repository contains the scripts and data required for the analysis outlined in our research paper titled 
"Gradients of neurotransmitter receptor expression in the macaque cortex". 
This paper describes the major patterns of receptor expression in the macaque cortex, including the discovery of two major axes of cortical receptor expression, from sensory-to-cognitive and external-to-internal cognition.

## Contents

This repository includes scripts that facilitate the following:

1. Surface representation of cyto- and receptor-architectonic atlas and receptor data.
2. Surface representation of neural density data.
3. Identification of receptor gradients.
4. Surface representation of dendritic data.
5. Analysis of cortical T1w/T2w data.
6. Cross-species functional alignment and functional connectivity data.
7. Analysis of human gene expression data.
8. Receptor expression within functional activity maps from NeuroQuery.
9. Statistical analysis.

Each of these analyses are performed using various datasets, including neural density data, dendritic data, T1w/T2w data, cross-species functional connectivity data, human gene expression data, and fMRI meta-analysis data.

The repository also includes the necessary code for preprocessing and analyzing gene expression data on the cortical surface, with features for visualizing this data and correlating it with other anatomical and functional maps.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and follow the instructions contained in the scripts. Note that some scripts may require the installation of specific software tools such as Connectome Workbench or FreeSurfer.

## Dependencies

The scripts in this repository are written in Matlab and may require specific Matlab packages. These include the Gifti toolbox.
